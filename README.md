# plotting_lib

This is a simple plotting library that I wrote for my own use. It is not meant to be a replacement for matplotlib or seaborn, but rather a simple way to make publication-quality plots with minimal effort. The library is built on top of matplotlib and seaborn, and it is designed to be easy to use and to produce visually appealing plots.


## Installation
Download the repository and run the following command in the root directory of the repository:

```bash
pip install .
```

## Styles
The library comes with a few built-in styles that can be used to customize the appearance of the plots. The available styles are:
- 'aps': A style to represent the size and font requirements for the APS journal family.
- 'nature': A style to represent the size and font requirements for the Nature journal family.
- 'quantum': A style to represent the size and font requirements of the Quantum journal.
